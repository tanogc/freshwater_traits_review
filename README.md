# Reviewing use of trait terms and concepts in Freshwater Ecology 

Code and data to reproduce the analyses of the article "Use of trait concepts and terminology in freshwater ecology: historic, current and future perspectives"

This code assesses variability in the current use of trait terminology through a literature review and survey of 414 freshwater researchers from 54 countries. First, the code provide descriptive statistics and plots of the use of trait terms in published  literature. Second, we explore how trait terms and concepts are used in relation to respondent characteristics (i.e., professional experience, geographical region, research discipline, and focal freshwater ecosystem, biotic group and ecosystem function).
